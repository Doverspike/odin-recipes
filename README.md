Odin Recipe Project

This is currently going to be a 'brutalist' website that will demonstrate the current skills the past few lessons have taught me.

A homepage (index page), with a title, header, linked image, links to multiple different recipes, and ordered or unordered list(s)

Each recipe page will have a linked image, ordered and unordered lists, a page title, headers, a body with paragraphs along with a link back to the homepage.

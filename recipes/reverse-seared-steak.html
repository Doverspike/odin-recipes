        <p><h3>Reverse Seared Smoked Steak</h3></p>
        <p>Following these simple steps you'll have a perfectly cooked and amazingly tasty steak
            in no time. All you need is a smoker or oven, your favorite wood to smoke (I enjoy hickory),
            and a good cut of steak preferably 1 inch thick.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Steak at least 1 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper, or you're favorite Steak Seasoning.</li>
            <li>If you're using a smoker, hickory wood / chips.</li>
            <li>A cast iron pan.</li>
            <li>Butter or Olive Oil (or both!)</li>
            </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the steak out of the refrigerator and pat dry.</li>
            <li>Coat both sides of the steak with Salt and Pepper, or your seasoning of choice.</li>
            <li>Heat up the smoker or oven to 225 degrees fahrenheit while the steak marinates warms up from the fridge.</li>
            <li>After at least 10 minutes, but preferable 30 minutes, place the steak in the smoker and cook at 225 for around 40 minutes depending on thickness. </li>
            <li>After 40 minutes take the steak out and lets it rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the steak is resting, heat up your cast iron skillet unless it is slightly smoking.</li>
            <li>Place your oil / butter into the center the skillet and follow immediately with your steak. You'll want to do this with both sides.</li>
            <li>Cook each side of the steak for 1 minute for a medium-rare steak. Add about 30 seconds if you want your steak cooked more.</li>
            <li>Let the steak rest for a few additional minutes and you're good to go.</li>
                </ol>
                    
        </ul>
